=================


General goals:
 * posix-like api
 * strong cryptography, following the ideas of curvecp -- but no protection against mitm attacks, no trusted CAs
 * resistance to replay attacks
 * resistance to DDOS attacks, no allocations on server-side connections
 * unencrypted data is just four bytes for protocol \0r#{version}#{proto}
 * initial implementation is simply retry on packets, but for the future LEDBAT for congestion control?
 * fast-enough to handle hundreds of connections
 * trust on first use

Design:
 there should be a worker thread that polls an underlying unix socket, and feeds messages into a queue only accessible by that thread, those messages are doled out to the calling thread by calls to accept, select, send, connect, send and recv.

 the worker thread polls the parent fd, and fills in buffers independent of calls to recv, and writes to the socket pair: https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Socket-Pairs.html

 sockets should only be accessed from one thread

 inspiration: https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg/blob/master/src/core/global.c

 there should be useful global statistics reporting

 dup the sockets.

Protocol:
 client                           server

 HELLO
 byte version
 32 bytes short term public key
 random padding

                                  COOKIE
                                  byte version
                                  32 bytes short term public key
                                  a cookie made up of
                                  Secret Key encrypted with server
                                  minute key and then client's public key

                                  message
 -----------------------------------------
 DATA
 byte version
 message


message format always 1088 - overhead - crypto_box_NONCEBYTES - crypto_box_PUBLICKEYBYTES
 uint32_t seq
 uint32_t ack
 time_t timestamp
 time_t delay
 size_t size < max_packet_size (1088 bytes)
 data

acks are sent every 500ms or combined with sending data
the resending algorithm follows tcp vegas
