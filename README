=================


General goals:
 * posix-like api
 * strong cryptography, following the ideas of curvecp -- but no protection against mitm attacks, no trusted CAs
 * resistance to replay attacks
 * resistance to DDOS attacks, no allocations on server-side connections
 * unencrypted data is just four bytes for protocol \0r#{version}#{proto}
 * initial implementation is simply retry on packets, but for the future LEDBAT for congestion control?
 * fast-enough to handle hundreds of connections

Design:
 there should be a worker thread that polls an underlying unix socket, and feeds messages into a queue only accessible by that thread, those messages are doled out to the calling thread by calls to accept, select, send, connect, send and recv.

 the worker thread polls the parent fd, and fills in buffers independent of calls to recv, and writes to the socket pair: https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Socket-Pairs.html

 sockets should only be accessed from one thread

 inspiration: https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg/blob/master/src/core/global.c

 there should be useful global statistics reporting

 refcount the sockets.

 nacl or sodium or tweetnacl (included)
