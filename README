=================


General goals:
 * posix-like api
 * strong cryptography, following the ideas of curvecp -- but no protection against mitm attacks, no trusted CAs
 * resistance to replay attacks
 * resistance to DDOS attacks, no allocations on server-side connections
 * unencrypted data is just four bytes for protocol \0r#{version}#{proto}
 * fast-enough to handle hundreds of connections
 * trust on first use

Design:
 there should be a worker thread that polls an underlying unix socket, and feeds messages into a queue only accessible by that thread, those messages are doled out to the calling thread by calls to accept, select, send, connect, send and recv.

 the worker thread polls the parent fd, and fills in buffers independent of calls to recv, and writes to the socket pair: https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Socket-Pairs.html

 sockets should only be changed from the main thread

 inspiration: https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg/blob/master/src/core/global.c

 there should be useful global statistics reporting

 connections are identified by connection public key to facilitate roaming. These keys are generated on a connection on connection basis.

requirements:
 nacl or sodium or tweetnacl (included)
 basic posix
 pthreads

Protocol:
 client                           server
 ----------------------------------------
 HELLO (repeats every 250ms until a response is heard)
 byte version
 32 bytes connection public key
 random padding
 ----------------------------------------
                                  COOKIE
                                  byte version
                                  32 bytes connection public key
                                  a cookie made up of
                                  connection Secret Key encrypted with server
                                  minute key and then client's public key
                                  random padding
 -----------------------------------------
 INIT
 byte version
 32 bytes connection public key
 nonce
 message with encrypted cookie
 -----------------------------------------
                                  DATA
                                  byte version
                                  32 bytes connection public key
                                  nonce
                                  message
 -----------------------------------------
 DATA
 byte version
 32 bytes connection public key
 nonce
 message


message format encrypted
 crypto_box_BOXZEROBYTES
 uint32_t seq
 uint32_t ack
 time_t timestamp
 time_t delay
 size_t size < max_packet_size (1088 bytes)
 data

the resending algorithm follows tcp vegas
